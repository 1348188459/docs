# Libretro core development

### Libretro API

The Libretro API is a lightweight C-based Application Programming Interface (API) that exposes generic audio, video, and input callbacks. Developers of "cores" such as standalone games, game emulators, media players, and other applications donâ€™t have to worry about writing different video drivers for Direct3D, OpenGL or worrying about catering to all possible input APIs, sound APIs, joypads, etc.

A frontend for libretro (such as RetroArch) handles video output, audio output, input and application lifecycle. A libretro core written in portable C or C++ can run seamlessly on many platforms with very little or no porting effort. Libretro bindings for other languages are growing increasingly common and comprehensive as well.

[Read more about the API in the developer documentation](api.md) or by [browsing the source of libretro.h itself](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/libretro/libretro-common/master/include/libretro.h) .

## Resources for core development

### Canonical `libretro.h`

The [most current canonical copy of `libretro.h`](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/libretro/libretro-common/master/include/libretro.h) can be found in the master branch of the libretro-common repository.

!!! tip
    `libretro.h` is the single most important technial reference for developers of libretro cores and frontends


### libretro-common

[`libretro-common`](https://github.com/libretro/libretro-common/] is a collection of essential cross-platform coding blocks useful for libretro core and frontend development, written primarily in C. Permissively licensed.

### libretro-deps

[`libretro-deps`](https://github.com/libretro-libretro-deps/] is a collection of third-party dependencies, pre-modified for use by libretro cores.
