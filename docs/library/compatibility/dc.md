# Sega Dreamcast Core Compatibility

## Reicast

General Reicast Issues

- The date and time do not seem to get properly saved, as the system will ask you to set the clock every time you start. 
- Once you save to a VMU slot with any game, that VMU becomes inaccessible the next time you load the emulator. 
- Polygon sorting issues can make objects appear distorted. 
- When using an Xbox 360 Controller, analog triggers don't work properly. Use the bumpers instead. 
- Changing games without closing and reloading RetroArch often leads to RetroArch crashing.

| Sonic Adventure (PAL)                       | Must be set to use "VGA" output in core options, as "TV" mode will cause all subsequent FMV to make RetroArch become unresponsive.                                                                                                                                     |
| Sonic Adventure 2 (USA)                     | Shadow volumes do not work right, so characters and other objects do not cast shadows. Text during score tally will flicker sometimes (Wild Canyon as Knuckles).                                                                                                       |
| Soul Calibur (PAL)                          | The sky during both the intro and matches will flicker. Text is occasionally garbled and misaligned.                                                                                                                                                                   |
| Super Runabout: San Francisco (USA)         | Crash to desktop with no error message.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |                                                                                                   |
