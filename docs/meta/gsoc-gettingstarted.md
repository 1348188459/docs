# Getting started with Libretro/RetroArch projects

Our recommendation is:

* Get used to the technologies listed in the idea pages (listed above) for your idea
* Go through the READMEs of the Libretro/RetroArch project(s) you're interested in and install, configure and run them on your machine
* Try fixing a bug of implementing a small feature listed for that project in Github issues. You can contact the community via the mailing list to ask for these if you can't find any.
* We also use Github issues for community reported issues. For example RetroArch has [some issues](https://github.com/libretro/RetroArch/issues) open at the time of writing this document.
