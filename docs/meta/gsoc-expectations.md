# Expectations from students when they are accepted

After you have done everything in the requirements section above, applied to the program and then accepted by Google; congrats! We will be very happy to have you in our community!

Here are some things we would expect from you during the coding in the summer:

* Communicate often, ask questions
* Commit your code early and often
* Prepare demos for your work so that the whole community can see the great stuff you develop
