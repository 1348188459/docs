# Requirements

These are the things students are expected to do:

* Check eligibility at <https://developers.google.com/open-source/gsoc/faq>
* Introduce yourself to the community via our Discord page : <https://discordapp.com/invite/27Xxm2h>
* Either pick one of the ideas at the [ideas page](http://docs.libretro.com/meta/gsoc-ideas/) or bring your own project idea
* Show interest in the technology and the products by trying them out and asking questions. Some code on Github and/or a demo would be great.
* Libretro/RetroArch expects students to make a non-trivial contribution before accepting the application. Trying to fix open bugs or working on issues 
  with label "GoodFirstTask" is a good idea. You can check the Github repositories for the issues and bugs.
  
We recommend reading [this](https://medium.com/@i.oleks/how-to-apply-for-google-summer-of-code-95c1bfcd41a5) great document to get some more tips for GSoC.
