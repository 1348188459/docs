Our [Discord channel](https://discordapp.com/invite/27Xxm2h) is the best option to engage with the community.

For quick queries, you can also use the IRC channel however there is no guarantee that you will get an answer immediately.

Also, in general, we would be happy to try help you in any way we can, but you will need to provide some good information. Think of it like opening a Github issue. The more information you can provide us with, the more likely someone will be able to help you.

* Explain what you are trying to do.
* Mention the Libretro/RetroArch project(s) or other technologies if it is important.
* If you are trying to solve a particular problem, please describe any of the solutions you have tried. Links to example code or documentation would be helpful.
* If you're looking for some extra information or help, please describe it in some more detail.

This is actually valid for all open source communities, not just our own. We would be more than happy to help.

You can also post an issue on our [Github issues page](https://github.com/libretro/RetroArch/issues).
